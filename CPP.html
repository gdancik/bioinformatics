<h2> Cancer Publication Portal (CPP) </h2>

<h3> Overview </h3>
<p> This is the homepage of a the <i> Cancer Publication Portal </i>, a tool for searching the biomedical literature for faster querying and summarizing of cancer-related publications.</p> 

<p>The tool currently leverages PubTator's annotation and provides interactive summaries of diseases, chemicals, and gene co-occurences for a selected human gene. <i>CPP</i> is a work in progress and additional features will be added shortly. Feedback regarding the tool is appreciated. </p> 

A <i> prototype</i> of the tool is available at <a href = "http://bioinformatics.easternct.edu/CPP/">http://bioinformatics.easternct.edu/CPP/</a>
