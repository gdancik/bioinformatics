<h3> Research Interests </h3>

I am broadly interested in <b>data science</b> as well as various aspects of <b> bioinformatics and computational biology</b>. My research involves applying statistical, mathematical, and computational models to answer biological questions and gain insight into biological systems. My more recent work has focused on analyzing gene expression data and identifying prognostic tumor biomarkers. For the <a href = "https://eida.easternct.edu">Eastern Institute for Data Analytics (EIDA)</a>, I am developing tools to make data more accessible and analyzing data to understand public health, economic, and other issues in the state of Connecticut. 

<p>
Specific research interests include 
<ol>
<li> the development of tools and models that increase data accessibility and provide data-driven insight into issues that impact CT 
<li> the development and application of bioinformatics and computational methods for analyzing large genomic datasets with applications in personalized medicine</li>
<li> the identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers and driver mutations in cancer </li>
<li> development, validation, and calibration of computational/mathematical models of biological systems </li>
<li> development of educational tools for statistics and bioinformatics </li>
</ol>
<h3> Research opportunities for students </h3>
Join the lab!</a> Students with a background in computer science in any programming language that are interested in bioinformatics research or data science are encouraged to contact me. I am currently developing bioinformatics tools to aid in the identification of cancer biomarkers from gene expression data, a text-mining project to organize cancer-related publications, and educational tools to help students learn R programming, data science, and bioinformatics. Please contact me if you are interested in on working on any of these projects.
