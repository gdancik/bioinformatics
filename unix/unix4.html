<h1>UNIX Tutorial Four </h1>
<h2>4.1 Wildcards and globbing</h2>
<h3>The characters * and ?</h3>
<p> UNIX shells will carry out <i>filename expansion</i>, based on wildcard characters, in a process known as <i>globbing</i>.  
<p>The character * is called a wildcard, and will match against none or more character(s) of any type 
  in a file (or directory) name. For example, in your <strong>unixstuff</strong> 
  directory, type </p>
<p class="command"> $ ls list*</p>
<p>This will list all files in the current directory starting with <i>list</i>. 
</p>
<p> Try typing </p>
<p class="command"> $ ls *list</p>
<p>This will list all files in the current directory ending with <i>list</i>. However, the filename expansion will not include hidden files beginning with a dot, such as .bash_profile. In order to list all hidden files, you can use </p>
<p class = "command"> ls -d .* </p>
<p> In the above, the -d option specifies that we do not want to recursively search directories for matching files. </p>
<p>The character ? will match exactly one character.<br />
  So<samp> ls ?ouse </samp>will match files like <i>house</i> and <i>mouse</i>, 
  but not <i>grouse</i>. <br />
  Try typing </p>
<p class="command"> $ ls ?list</p>
<p> When globbing is used, the filename is expanded and the command executed using this expansion, which may contain multiple files. To see the expansion itself, you can type</p>
<p class = "command">echo list*</p>
<p> Suppose that this returns <i>list1 list2</i>. Then the command <samp> ls list*</samp> executes the command <samp>ls list1 list2</samp>. Similarly, the command <samp>grep</samp> can be used to search multiple files. For example, to search all (non-hidden) files in a directory for the word Linux, type
<p class = "command">grep Linux * </p>     
<h3> Matching a range of characters </h3>
<p> Square brackets are used to indicate that a match to one of the specified characters is desired. For example,try typing</p>
<p class = "command"> ls -d [al]* </p>
<p> This will list all files in the current directory begining with either an 'a' or an 'l'.</p> <p>Within brackets, a hyphen can be used to denote a range. For example, to list all files beginning with any letter between (and including) a to k, you can type</p>
<p class = "command"> ls -d [a-k]* </p> 
<h3> Exercise 4a </h3>
<p> Write commands for the following:
<ol>
<li> list all files that end in .txt </li>
<li> list all files that end in a number (i.e., any digit between 0 and 9) </li>
<li> list all files that contain a number </li>  
</ol>   

<h3> Globbing vs. Regular Expressions </h3>  
<p>  
Be aware that there is a related 'pattern matching' grammar known as regular expressions (regex), which are used by utilities such as <samp>grep</samp> and in scripting languages such as perl. There are important differences between globbing and regular expressions. For example, the character * in a regular expression means "zero or more of the <i>preceeding</i> character". For example, the command
<p class = "command"> ls h*t </p>
<p> will list all files that start with h and end in t, such as hat, hot, halt, and hoist. However, the command</p> 
<p class = "command"> grep h*t file.txt </p> 
<p>will match any lines containing one or more 'h's followed by a t, such as ht, ahht, ZZZhhhhht123, etc. For more on reglar expressions, click <a href = "http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheetgrep.php">here</a> for a grep cheat sheet. </p>

<h2>4.2 Filename conventions </h2>
<p>We should note here that a directory is merely a special type of file. So the 
  rules and conventions for naming files apply also to directories. </p>
<p> In naming files, characters with special meanings such as <strong>/ * &amp; 
  $</strong> , should be avoided. Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest 
  way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters 
  and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot). </p>
<p> File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter, and may end with 
  a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For 
  example, all files consisting of C code may be named with the ending .c, for 
  example, prog1.c . Then in order to list all files containing C code in your 
  home directory, you need only type <samp>ls *.c</samp> in that directory. </p>
<h3>Exercise 4b </h3>
<p>What command can you use to search all C code files (ending in .c) and printing the line and line number for each line containing the word <i>sum</i>? </p>

<h2>4.3 Getting Help</h2>
<h3>On-line Manuals</h3>
<p>There are on-line manuals which gives information about most commands. These built-in 
  manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each 
  option modifies the behaviour of the command. Type <samp>man command</samp> to read the manual 
  page for a particular command. </p>
<p> For example, to find out more about the <samp>wc</samp> (word count) command, 
  type </p>
<p class="command"> $ man wc </p>
<p> The correct usage of a command is described under <samp>Synopsis</samp>, where options or arguments in brackets are optional.</p><p>For example, the usage for <samp>wc</samp> is <samp>wc [-clmw] [file ...]</samp>, with optional flags for outputting the number of bytes in each file, number of lines, characters, and words. The ellipses (<samp>...</samp>) indicate that one or more files can be specified. If no files are specified, then standard input is used. For example, to display the number of words and lines in the files <samp>list1</samp> and <samp>list2</samp>, type </p>
<p class = "command"> $ wc -wl list1 list2 </p>          
<p> An alternate way of getting help is given by the following example, </p>
<p class="command"> $ whatis wc </p>
<p> which gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any information about 
  options etc. </p>
<h3> Exercise 4c </h3>
<p> Look at the online manual for <samp>ls</samp>, and note that there are many options. However, we can quickly identify options because the output of the man command can be piped!</p>
<ol>
<li> Using piping, print all lines from the online manual for ls that contains the word "Sort" or "sort". Note that the lines displayed are not necessarily consecutive lines (which can be seen clearly by using the <samp>-n</samp> option to <samp>grep</samp>), but this approach can be used to identify options for (2) and (3) below.</li> Note that man pages can also be searched in the same way that output from the <samp>less</samp> command can be sorted. This may be useful for identifying options as well.
<li> Sort the files list1 and list2 by "time modified". </li>
<li> Sort the files list1 and list2 by size, displaying the files using the "long format" and with "unit suffixes".   
</ol>   
<h3>Apropos</h3>
<p>When you are not sure of the exact name of a command, </p>
<p class="command"> $ apropos keyword </p>
<p> will give you the commands with keyword in their manual page header. For example, 
  try typing </p>
<p class="command"> $ apropos copy </p>
